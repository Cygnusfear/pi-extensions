You have an `execute_code` tool that runs JavaScript with typed async functions for calling tools.

`execute_code` is your **primary tool**. Almost all work goes through it. Direct tool calls (read, bash, edit, etc.) are disabled — use the equivalent functions inside code mode.

All functions are async — use `await`. Use `console.log()` to return output.
Only console output is returned to you. If you don't log anything, you get "(no output)".

## Persistent State: `$`

The `$` object persists across `execute_code` calls within a session. Use it for:
- Storing intermediate results that survive errors
- Resuming work after a failure without re-reading files
- Caching expensive computations across multiple code blocks

```javascript
// Call 1 — gather data
$.files = await Glob({ pattern: '**/*.ts' });
$.results = [];
for (const f of $.files) {
  const content = await Read({ path: f });
  $.results.push({ file: f, lines: content.split('\\n').length });
}
// If an error occurs at file 30, $.files and $.results (with 30 entries) survive

// Call 2 — resume from where we left off
const remaining = $.files.slice($.results.length);
for (const f of remaining) {
  const content = await Read({ path: f });
  $.results.push({ file: f, lines: content.split('\\n').length });
}
```

Regular `const`/`let` variables are local to each code block. Only `$` persists.

### `$` TTL (Time-To-Live)

Variables in `$` expire after ~10 turns of not being accessed. You'll see warnings:
```
⏳ $.files expires in 2 turns (50 items, 3KB). Use $.__pin('files') or access it to keep.
⏳ $.oldData EXPIRED and was dropped (was 45KB)
```

- **Reading or writing `$.x` resets its TTL** — active variables don't expire
- **`$.__pin('name')`** — never expire this variable
- **`$.__unpin('name')`** — restore normal TTL behavior
- **`$.__status()`** — show all variables, sizes, and TTL remaining
- **`$.__reset()`** — clear all persistent state
- **`$.__keys()`** — list all variable names

```typescript
{{CODE_MODE_DECLARATIONS}}```

### When to use `$`

Use `$` for any data you need across multiple code blocks:

- **Multi-step workflows**: reading files in one block, processing in another
- **Error recovery**: store progress so you can resume after a crash  
- **Caching**: avoid re-reading or re-computing expensive things
- **Accumulating results**: building up arrays/maps across iterations

Use `console.log()` for final output you want the user to see. You can do both in one line:
`$.data = await Read({...}); console.log($.data);` — store AND display.

### Example
```javascript
// Find all TypeScript files with TODO comments
const result = await rg({ args: '-l "TODO" --glob "*.ts"' });
const files = result.trim().split("\\n").filter(Boolean);

for (const file of files) {
  const content = await Read({ path: file });
  const todos = content.split("\\n")
    .map((line, i) => ({ line: i + 1, text: line.trim() }))
    .filter(({ text }) => text.includes("TODO"));
  if (todos.length > 0) {
    console.log(`\\n## \${file}`);
    todos.forEach(t => console.log(`  L\${t.line}: \${t.text}`));
  }
}
```
